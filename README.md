ðŸš€**Blockchain-Based eVault for Legal Documents with Ethereum and IPFS** ðŸ“„

**Overview**
This project leverages blockchain technology to securely store and retrieve legal documents using the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS. By integrating smart contracts and IPFS, the project ensures that legal documents are tamper-proof, securely stored, and easily accessible with clearly defined permissions.

**Features**
- **Ethereum Blockchain:** Utilize Ethereum for secure, transparent, and immutable document storage and retrieval.
- **IPFS Integration:** Store legal documents on IPFS, generating a unique hash for each document, ensuring data integrity and decentralization.
- **Smart Contracts:** Develop smart contracts to define and enforce access permissions for the stored documents.
- **Moralis API:** Use Moralis APIs to facilitate the interaction between IPFS and Ethereum, handling hash generation and storage seamlessly.
- **Frontend Integration:** Connect the smart contract to a frontend using Web3.js, enabling users to interact with the blockchain.
- **Web Development:** Build a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

**Requirements**
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Ethereum Wallet**: For deploying and interacting with the smart contract
- **Web3.js**: For frontend blockchain interaction
- **Moralis API**: For seamless IPFS and Ethereum integration
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface

**Usage**
1. **Deploy the Smart Contract:** Define access permissions and document retrieval rules within the smart contract and deploy it on the Ethereum network.
2. **Upload Documents to IPFS:** Use Moralis API to upload documents to IPFS, generating a unique hash for each document.
3. **Store Document Hash on Blockchain:** Store the generated hash on the Ethereum blockchain using the deployed smart contract.
4. **Frontend Integration:** Build a frontend interface that interacts with the smart contract using Web3.js, allowing users to securely store, retrieve, and manage access to documents.
5. **Access Control:** Use the smart contract to enforce permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify documents.

**Example Usage**
This project demonstrates a robust and secure method for storing legal documents using blockchain technology. By following the outlined steps, you can deploy smart contracts, manage document storage on IPFS, and build a web interface that securely interacts with the Ethereum blockchain to protect sensitive legal information.
